# Task-Tracker
### We have been build a simple task tracker app with [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8)

- we can add task with name, date & time and reminder when we click on **Add** button in application
- we can remove any task we want
- we can add or remove reminder with duble click on any task we want (reminder is a green border on the left side of the task)
